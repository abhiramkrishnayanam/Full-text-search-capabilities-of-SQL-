# Full-Text Search in SQL

## ðŸ“– Introduction
Full-Text Search (FTS) is a powerful feature in SQL that allows efficient and intelligent searching of text data stored in databases. It is an advanced alternative to traditional `LIKE` queries, particularly for large datasets or when searching text-heavy fields like names, descriptions, or articles.
